      Good day!
    </p>
    <p>
      When creating the text for this section in the header, I initially wrote a rather long heartfelt story about how my hobby turned into a profession. I recalled with nostalgia and vividly described my experience, interesting events from my life... But I soon realized that this piece of biography takes up a lot of space, and examples of work and my skills go down the page. And I just really like my job and I can talk about it for hours. But I'll be brief...

      I am a programmer, web developer, aspiring web designer and system administrator. At the beginning of my journey, information technology was just my passion. I created hobby projects, took part in other people's projects, often on a voluntary basis, simply because I was very interested. Only a few years later, I decided to take up development more thoroughly and turn my hobby into a profession. Below you will see a rather large list of my skills and I ask you to understand me correctly. I have a really broad erudition in the field of IT, but I do not pretend to be an expert in all the announced areas. Simply, the projects in which I took part were too motley. I left my subjective rating for each skill. They often said about me “and a Swiss, and a reaper, and a gambler on the pipe.” Now I try in every possible way to move away from my generalism and focus on a small stack of technologies and tools. However, the wide profile still often makes it possible to find optimal solutions for non-standard tasks.

      As for my commercial experience (more details in the summary, in the header). I worked for Internet providers for hire, officially as a web developer, and in fact, performing the duties of a web designer, and a system administrator, and a layout designer / interface developer, and a Backend developer, and sometimes a content manager. This is due to the fact that these companies are located in the small town of Kimry, serve the Tver region and cannot afford to maintain a large staff. Then there was a web studio, where I focused more on developing websites and web applications, and then freelancing on the UpWork international exchange. By the time I started working remotely, I already knew English and Spanish quite well. This allowed me to take part in various projects around the globe.

      And I would continue to work through this exchange if it were not for the events of February 24, 2022. Already in March, sanctions were imposed against Russia, and soon the UpWork suspended my account.
